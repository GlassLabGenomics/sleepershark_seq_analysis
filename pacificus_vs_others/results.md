## _How does varying the k-mer size affect results?_

### K-mer size and minimum sequence length (k, s)

(25,100): default, no unique sequence segments returned

We try decreasing the minimum sequence length while holding the k-mer size constant, to roughly find an optimum where size is not compromised but unique segments can be found.

(25, 80)

(25, 70)

(25, 60)

(25, 50)

(25, 40)

(25, 30)

Then we try increasing the k-mer size while holding the minimum sequence length constant at 60.

(40, 60)

(45, 60)

(50, 60)

(55, 60)

(60, 60)

## _Do the unique sequence segments match with primers found visually?_

## _What are the main unique zones as visualised with the butterfly plot?_
