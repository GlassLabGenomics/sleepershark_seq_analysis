Sleeper Shark (in silico) barcoding
===================================

This repository contains scripts and example files to run unikseq on sleeper shark mitogenomes, with the purpose of finding identifying regions for target species to amplify with qPCR. The link to the tool is given here: [unikseq tool](https://github.com/bcgsc/unikseq), and the corresponding publication: [Allison et al. 2023](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/edn3.438).
